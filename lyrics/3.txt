I'm so ready to get gone
I'm feeling like a powerful girl
So come with me, let's go
Together we can take on the world
'Cause, we're so beyond, living like we're typical girls
So take my hand and join me
Singing, "Hey! hey! hey! okay!"
The world is ours
もしもし
Hi, hello
Did you call to talk to me?
はじめ こんにちは
I like you and you like me
It's time to say hello to a new day
And have a cup of tea with my very best friend
Whoa, oh-oh, oh
Are you ready to get lost?
Let's climb up to the highest peaks
And climb higher above the clouds
You and I can do anything
'Cause, we're so far gone
Living like the typical girls
So take my hand and join me
Singing, "Hey! hey! hey! okay!"
The world is ours

Living like the typical girls
So take my hand and join me
Singing, "Hey! hey! hey! okay!"
